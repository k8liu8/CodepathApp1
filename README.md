### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge that I encountered while buliding the app was that there were only 2 columns of posters showing, which I was able to fix after dragging the view controller beyond the size of the phone screen to get 3 columns of posters.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
